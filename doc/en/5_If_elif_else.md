# If elif else statement
in the previous part, you learned how to use **sections** for creating **Conditions** and **Loops**.
but there is a easy way to create **Conditions**, that is **If..elif..else** statement. this system is very easy for creating conditions and handling program flow.

example:

```bash
if 2 == 2
    println 'yes, 2 is 2'
endif
```

or:

```bash
if 3 == 7
    println '3 is 7'
else
    println '3 is NOT 7'
endif
```

in this part, we learn how to use this system.
