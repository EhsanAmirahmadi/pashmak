## Basics

a simple printing in pashmak on screen:

```bash
mem 'some thing to print\n'; out ^;
```

#### how it works?

first, we browse about pashmak syntax structure.
the base structure of pashmak syntax is this:

```bash
<operation> [arguments];
<operation> [arguments];
<operation> [arguments]; <operation> [arguments];
```

in this example, we have two operations:

```bash
mem 'some thing to print\n'; # first operation
out ^; # second operation
```

here, mem is a operation and `'something to print\n'` is argument of that, and
out is a operation and `^` is argument of that.

but what is the function of this code?

when you run the script in terminal:

```bash
pashmak myscript.pashm # or any filename you saved code in that
```

you will get this output:

```
something to print
```

this code, prints `'some thing to print'` on the stdout.
but how?

first, `mem` command brings the string `'some thing to print'` in memory, and next `out` command prints the memory value on screen.

### what is `mem`?
you cannot print any thing like this:

```bash
out 'hello world\n';
```

because commands in pashmak never gets a value directly.
if you want to pass a value to the commands, you need to use `mem` command to load that value.
in this example, first, `mem` command loads the `'some thing to print'`, and next, we pass value of mem to the `out` command:

```bash
mem 'hello world';
out ^; # the ^ is pointer of mem
```

the ^ is pointer of mem

you can also write the code like this to have shorter code:

```bash
mem 'hello world\n'; out ^;
```

###### NOTE: remember to put \n when you want to go to the next line

#### mem is temp

look at this example:

```bash
mem 'some thing\n';

out ^; # output: some thing

out ^; # output: None
```

why in the first time when mem value was read, the value correctly was printed on screen, but in the second time, the `None` was printed?

because memory is temporary. when you read the memory, that will be empty after read automaticly.

look at this example:

```bash
mem 'first value\n';
out ^;

mem 'second value\n';
out ^;
```

output of this code:

```
first value
second value
```

###### NOTE: the # character is comment operation. you can put comment in your code after # character


### more about mem
you can calculate every thing in mem

for undrestanding, look at the following examples:

```bash
mem 'hi there'; out ^; # output: hi there

# you can paste strings
mem 'first string ' + 'last string'; # output: first string last string

# run math operations
mem 2*7; out ^; # output: 14

mem 3*(2+1); out ^; # output: 9

mem str(7*7) + ' is sum'; out ^; # output: 49 is sum
# the `str` function gets a value and convert it to string.
# in here you can not paste number to string. first need to convert num to str with str()
```

the `mem` command is absolutely important and you need to use it everywhere

#### print `;`
for printing `;` character, put a `\` before semicolon:

```bash
mem 'this is \; semicolon\n'; out ^;
```

output:

```
this is ; semicolon
```
